this is my 2nd project with qa

<h1>About the project:</h1>

<p>getting started(requirments.txt)</p>

<h2>roadmap: There will be a total of 4 micro-services:</h2>

<p><b>service 1</b>
 this would be my random number generator the goal of this is to have 8 numbers generated randomly (1-8) 4 even and 4 odd numbers.

<b>service 2</b>
this would be my random letter generator with 4 vowels (A,E,I,U) and 4 non-vowels (B,F,J,V)

<b>service 3</b>
 this would bring the mixed string (8 random letter and numbers (4 of each)) together and then have the string pinned against a set criteria in order to win a prize. the conditions would be as follows: 2 even + 2 vowels = gold prize 2 even + 1 vowel / 1 even + 2 vowels = silver prize 2 even or 2 vowels = bronze prize 1 even or 1 vowel = no prize ("you lose")

<b>service 4 </b>
 this would be the front end i.e flask + html</p>
